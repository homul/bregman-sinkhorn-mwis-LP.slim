======Provide the problem to the solver =====================

======Problem dimensions =====================
Number of nodes in the original problem = 4
Number of cliques = 2
Number of nodes including slacks = 6

======Run the dual solver ====================================
[32mDual Solver for Max-Weight Independent Set Problem based on the Bregman-Sinkhorn smoothed dual coordinate descent.
[31mNo primal heuristic[32m is computed, only dual updates and truncation projection to the feasible set of the LP relaxation.
Randomized greedy solutions can be generated additionally.[0m

# nodes = 6
# cliques = 2
# dual iterations per batch = 50
max. # batches = 1000000
integer primal interations starts only after reaching 0.1% relaxed duality gap

min-max clique cost=1, threshold=1e-08; x-coordinates to be ignored= 66.6667%
average clique size=4; average reduced clique size=1 (25 %)

Relaxed duality gap = 0< 0.1%, dual optimization stopped.


Final optimization results: primal relaxed=0.70000000000000007 dual bound=0.70000000000000007 duality gap=0% 
Total run-time of the dual solver 0.00032314300000000002 seconds.
